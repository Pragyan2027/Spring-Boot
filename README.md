# 🚀 Spring Boot Learning Journey

Hi there! 👋  
I'm currently diving deep into the **Spring Boot ecosystem**, exploring various core and advanced modules that power enterprise-grade Java applications.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

### 🧱 Core Spring Framework
- Understanding **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and **Dependency Injection (DI)**
- Creating loosely-coupled components using **Spring Containers**

### ⚙️ Spring Boot
- Auto-configuration & embedded servers
- Building RESTful APIs with ease
- Simplified project setup with `spring-boot-starter` dependencies

### 📊 Spring Data JPA
- Object-Relational Mapping using **JPA/Hibernate**
- Writing custom queries with **JPQL** and **mySQL**
- Mastering repositories and database relationships

### 🔐 Spring Security
- Implementing authentication & authorization
- Securing endpoints using roles and permissions
- JWT-based security and session management

### 🌀 Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, transactions)
- Creating custom aspects with `@Aspect` and `@Around`

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This
To master backend development using **Java + Spring Boot** and become proficient in building scalable, secure, and maintainable applications.

## 📁 Projects & Practice
Stay tuned! I’ll be uploading hands-on projects and mini-applications as I progress. Each project will demonstrate real-world implementations of the above topics.
